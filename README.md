## Example

Compare and contrast to [Vega Runtime documentation](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Runtime):

```clj
(ns example
  (:require [vega-tools.core :refer [validate-and-parse]]
            [promesa.core :as p]))

(defn main []
 (let [spec {:width 200 :height 200
             :marks [{:type "symbol"
                      :properties {:enter {:size {:value 1000}
                                           :x {:value 100}
                                           :y {:value 100}
                                           :shape {:value "circle"}
                                           :stroke {:value "red"}}}}]}]
    (-> (validate-and-parse spec)
        (p/catch #(js/alert (str "Unable to parse spec:\n\n" %)))
        (p/then #(-> #js {:el (js/document.getElementById "#chart")}
                     (%)
                     (.update))))))
```
